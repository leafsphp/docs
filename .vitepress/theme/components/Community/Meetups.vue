          Our first community meet up was in 2023 which we held together with SeevCash. Since then our community has
          gotten bigger, growing together with Leaf and all the tools in the ecosystem. Join our young but vibrant
          community and the Leaf team as we discuss our insights from the past year and whatâ€™s to come in the next
          couple of years ðŸš€
