      <p>Leaf prides itself on itâ€™s ease of use, and especially its ease of deployment. Leaf will happily run anywhere
        PHP is available without asking any questions. Shared hosting? No problem, just drag and drop!</p>

      <h1 class="!text-5xl mb-8">Blazing fast, memory light...</h1>
      <p>Whether you run PHP 7 or PHP 8, Leaf wrings out every last drop of performance it can from your system while
        keeping memory usage to the bare minimum. Leaf vastly outpaces most popular PHP frameworks, and nothing comes
        close when you throw in those memory benefits</p>
