# Modules

Modules are the building blocks of Leaf. They are independent pieces of Leaf's functionality available for use in your app. They are designed to be simple, easy to use, framework-agnostic, and can be used in any PHP project with nearly zero configuration.

## Installing Modules

Modules are just like regular PHP packages. You can install them using Composer. To install a module, run:

```bash:no-line-numbers
composer require leafs/<module>
```

If you're using Leaf CLI, you can install a module without the `leafs/` prefix:

```bash:no-line-numbers
leaf install <module>
```

## Using Modules

Most modules integrate directly into Leaf, so you can use them with Leaf's functional mode. This gives you a little more performance and flexibility. The documentation for each module covers everything you need to know about using the module.

## List of Modules

*We update this list regularly. If you have a module you'd like to see here, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/leafsphp/docs/issues/new) or create a pull request on our documentation repository. Community created modules are welcome here too ❤️*
