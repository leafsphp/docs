# Leaf Zero <Badge>NEW</Badge>

<script setup>
import TutorialNumber from '@theme/components/shared/TutorialNumber.vue';
</script>

A free collection of pre-built components, page sections, and templates designed to help you build faster. With Tailwind for styling, Alpine.js/React/Vue/Svelte for interactivity, and ready-to-use Blade and PHP snippets, you can skip the boilerplate and focus on shipping. Just copy, paste, and customizeâ€”whether you're building a landing page or a full app, Leaf Zero gives you the building blocks to move fast.

::: info Zero UI Support

We try to provide support for Alpine, React, Vue and Svelte on every component, however, some things like Modals, Toasts and Icons are currently Blade/Alpine only. We will add support for React, Vue and Svelte later, but for now Shadcn UI has a ton of components you can use with React, Vue and Svelte.

## Page Sections

Find page sections like headers, footers, features, pricing, and more. Each section is a standalone component that you can mix and match to create your own custom pages.
