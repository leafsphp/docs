# Why Choose Leaf

When it comes to building web applications, there are countless tools and frameworks available. However, we firmly believe that Leaf is the ideal choice for developing powerful web applications and APIs.

## Today's Challenges

While PHP frameworks can accelerate and streamline web development, they come with several potential challenges:

- **Steep Learning Curve**: Many PHP frameworks have a significant learning curve, particularly for developers new to the language or the framework's conventions. They may require lots of time and effort to spin up even a basic application.

- **Performance Overhead**: Some PHP frameworks introduce unnecessary performance overhead due to their additional abstraction layers and built-in features.

- **Complex Maintenance**: Frameworks often require adherence to specific coding standards and conventions, which can complicate maintenance and updates if you're not already familiar with those standards.

- **Limited Flexibility**: PHP frameworks can be more rigid than writing custom code, requiring adherence to specific standards and conventions. This can restrict your flexibility in structuring your code and handling unique use cases.

- **Compatibility Issues**: Most PHP frameworks are tightly integrated into specific ecosystems, making it difficult to use packages that aren’t natively supported by the framework.

- **Bloat and Unnecessary Code**: Many PHP frameworks add complexity by including unused code, classes, and packages, leading to bloat and decreased performance.

## How Leaf Addresses These Challenges

Leaf 3 offers a range of features specifically designed to overcome these common issues found in many PHP frameworks.

### Low Barrier to Entry

Leaf is incredibly easy to learn, with PHP beginners building powerful Leaf applications within minutes of exploring the documentation or watching tutorial videos. All you need to get started with Leaf is a basic understanding of PHP, and optionally, some knowledge of backend concepts like JWT authentication.

### Lightweight and Fast

Leaf 2 was already considered one of the most lightweight and powerful frameworks available, but Leaf 3 takes this even further. Leaf 3 is an incredibly lightweight PHP framework, with a source code base of about 30KB, allowing you to build full applications and APIs that are under 20MB, even with user dependencies. This is a stark contrast to other frameworks that require dependencies and numerous files, often exceeding 100MB.

### High Developer Productivity

Extensive research and testing have gone into developing features that enable developers to focus solely on what matters: their applications. Leaf 3 introduces a range of strategies to create the best developer experience in PHP, such as eliminating class initializers and providing global functions that allow you to call classes from anywhere in your application, along with other innovative features.

### Powered by Modules

Leaf 3 and its ecosystem are heavily driven by [modules](/docs/modules)—individual pieces of Leaf's functionality packaged into independently installable libraries. Modules make Leaf even more lightweight by allowing developers to include only the features they need in their applications. This means you only install what you require.

### Intuitive and Easy-to-Use Features

As part of the effort to enhance the developer experience, Leaf 3's existing features have been made more performant and user-friendly. We adopted strategies like modeling some features after popular libraries in other languages and frameworks. For example, the API for Leaf's CORS functionality closely resembles the Express.js CORS middleware.

### Compatibility with Libraries and Frameworks

From the outset, Leaf has been designed to integrate seamlessly with other libraries and frameworks. Regardless of Leaf's power, we prioritize simple concepts, unlike other frameworks that require complex setups like providers to access framework features within libraries.

### Scalability

One of Leaf's most impressive qualities is its scalability. Regardless of the package you're using with Leaf, if it works in development, it will work in production with minimal configuration—unless you require specific features. Leaf's core, along with its ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, makes it suitable for projects of any size.
