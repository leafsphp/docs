Leaf Auth provides a flexible and secure login system that works for both token based and session based authentication. It provides a unified way to authenticate users in your web apps and APIs.

::: details Token vs Session Authentication

- Token based authentication is a system where a user is given a token upon login which is then used to authenticate the user on every request. It is the most common authentication system for APIs. This video by Hamy Labs explains how token authentication works

- Session-based authentication is a method where, after a user logs in, the server creates a session to remember them. Every time the user makes a request, their session ID is sent back to the server to verify their identity, allowing them to stay logged in while using the app.

## Database Pre-requisites

Leaf Auth doesn't force you to use any specific structure for your database, so youâ€™re free to organize it however you like. But, there are a few important things to keep in mind to make sure everything works smoothly.

### Specifying the table to use

Leaf assumes that you will save your users in a table named `users`. If you want to use a different table, you can configure Leaf Auth using `db.table`:

```php:no-line-numbers
auth()->config('db.table', 'admins');
```

### Specifying the primary key

Most databases use `id` as the primary key. If you are using a different field as the primary key, you can configure Leaf Auth using `id.key`:

```php:no-line-numbers
auth()->config('id.key', 'admin_id');
```

If you are using UUIDs as your primary key, you just need to pass in your primary key instead of leaving it up to Leaf to generate it:

```php{2}
auth()->register([
  'id' => 'your-uuid',
  ...
]);
```

Once Leaf detects a field with the same name as your primary key, it will use that field as the primary key.

## Signing a user up

To sign a user up is to create a new user account on your application. This is usually done by collecting the user's details and storing them in your database. You also need to validate the user's details to ensure they are correct and that they don't conflict with existing data.

Leaf allows you to do all this using the `register()` method. This method takes in an array of data you want to use to create the user.

```php
auth()->register([
  'username' => 'example',
  'email' => 'm@example.com',
  'password' => 'password'
]);
```

If the user is successfully saved in the database, a session or token is created for them and the user is returned. If Leaf Auth fails to save the user, the method returns `null`. You can then use the `errors()` method to get the error message.

```php
$data = auth()->register([
  'username' => 'example',
  'email' => 'user@example.com',
  'password' => 'password'
]);

if ($data) {
  // User is authenticated
  $token = $data->token;
  $user = $data->user;
} else {
  // User is not authenticated
  $error = auth()->errors();
}
```

## Unique fields

There are some fields in your database that should not be repeated for different users. For example, you wouldn't want two users to have the same email address. You can configure Leaf Auth to check for unique fields when a user is being registered:

```php:no-line-numbers
auth()->config('unique', ['email', 'username']);
```

Now if a user tries to register with an email or username that already exists in the database, Leaf Auth will return an error. You can get the error message using the `errors()` method.

```php
$data = auth()->register([
  'username' => 'example',
  'email' => 'example@example.com',
  'password' => 'password'
]);

if (!$data) {
  $error = auth()->errors();
  // ['email' => 'The email already exists']
}
```

## Using timestamps

Leaf will always try to set the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in your database. If you want to turn this off, you can set `timestamps` to `false`:

```php:no-line-numbers
auth()->config('timestamps', false);
```

One thing to watch out for is the format of the timestamp. Different databases have different accepted timestamp formats. If you get an error concerning the format of the timestamp, you can configure Leaf Auth to use a different format:

```php:no-line-numbers
auth()->config('timestamps.format', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS');
```

You can find the date format documentation [here](/docs/utils/date#formatting-dates).

## Hiding sensitive information

The output of Leaf's authentication methods is an object with the user's data and the token or session. By default, the password field is hidden from the user data. This is a security measure to prevent the password from being exposed.

```php
[
  'user' => [
    'username' => 'mychidarko',
    'email' => 'user@example.com',
    'created_at' => '2019-09-20 13:47:48'
  ],
  'token' => 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1NzYxMzUzMjgsImlzcyI6ImxvY2FsaG9zdCIsImV4cCI6MTU3NjEzNjIyOCwidXNlcklkIjoxfQ.7FODXGGJKioGQVX4ic0DJLoMIQTVUlsd4zFAJA4DAkg'
]
```

If you want to customize what items are hidden from the user data, you can configure Leaf Auth to hide them:

```php:no-line-numbers
auth()->config('hidden', ['password', 'id', 'email', ...]);
```

## Switching to session auth

Leaf uses token based authentication by default which uses a JWT to authenticate your users. Sessions are a more common way to authenticate users in fullstack applications. To switch to session based authentication, you can update your auth config:

```php:no-line-numbers
auth()->config('session', true);
```

Switching to session auth does not change the default behaviour of the `register()` method. It won't create a session or do anything fancy by default. If you want to create a session immediately after signing a user up, you can pass true to the `session.register` config:

```php:no-line-numbers
auth()->config('session.register', true);

...

// will create a session
$data = auth()->register([
  'username' => 'example',
  'email' => 'example@example.com',
  'password' => 'password'
]);

if ($data) {
  response()->redirect('/dashboard');
} else {
  $error = auth()->errors();
  // ['email' => 'The email already exists']
}
```

You can also control things like the cookie settings and more:

```php
auth()->config('session.cookie', [
  'secure' => true,
  'httponly' => true,
  'samesite' => 'lax'
]);
```
