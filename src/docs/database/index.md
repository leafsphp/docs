A database is like a big, organized storage system where your applications can keep and manage data. Imagine it as a digital drawer for storing information like user profiles, messages, or product details.

Leaf provides a powerful but lightweight database module that helps you interact with your database in a simple and efficient way. Leaf's database module is built on top of PDO, and currently offers first-class support for five database systems: 

- MariaDB
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- SQL Server
