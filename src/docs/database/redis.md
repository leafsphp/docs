# Leaf Redis

Redis is like a powerful database, but instead of storing data on a hard drive like other databases, Redis keeps everything in memory (RAM), making it much super-fast. It's often used for things that need to be accessed really fast, like caching (storing temporary data), session management, or tracking real-time data.

Leaf includes a Redis module that allows you to easily integrate Redis into your Leaf application.
