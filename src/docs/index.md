# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Leaf is a slim and lightweight PHP framework focused on developer experience, usability, and high-performance code. It is a modern PHP framework built to be simple and elegant, yet extremely powerful.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

app()->get('/', function () {
  response()->json(['message' => 'Hello World!']);
});

app()->run();
```

Writing code should be simple and fun, and that's what Leaf is all about.

Leaf is built to be modular, so you can use only what you need. There's no need to learn a whole new framework to use Leaf, just familiarize yourself with the core concepts and you're good to go. This makes Leaf a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers.
