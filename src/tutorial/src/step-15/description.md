# You Did It!

You've learnt how to create routes, handle requests, and responses, and even how to use some of Leaf's modules to make your app more powerful.

As a next step, you can:

- Set up a real project on your system by following the [installation docs](/docs/installation).

- Every feature you need is available as a module, so be sure to checkout the [modules documentation](/docs/modules).

- Join the [Leaf Discord server](https://discord.gg/SpmNs4S) to ask questions, share what you're building, and get help from the community.

- Follow Leaf on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leafphp) to stay up-to-date with the news and updates.

We can't wait to see what you build next! ðŸš€
