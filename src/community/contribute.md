# How can I contribute to Leaf?

Leaf is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Your help is essential, and we're grateful for it. There are many ways to contribute to Leaf, from writing code to improving the documentation.

## Reporting issues

If you find a bug in Leaf, please report it on our [GitHub](https://github.com/leafsphp/) organization. We appreciate detailed bug reports, including steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant information about your environment. Also, please check if the issue has already been reported before creating a new one.

Another thing we appreciate is reporting issues on the right repository. For instance, if you find a bug in `Leaf\Auth`, please report it on the leafsphp/auth repository. We have a lot of modules, so it's important to report issues on the right repository to ensure they get the attention they need.

## Join our Discord server

We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Pkrm9NJPE3) where you can ask questions, share your projects, and get help from the community. We're always happy to help you with any questions you have about Leaf. You can also help others in the community by answering their questions.

## Helping out with issues

If you're a developer, you can help out by contributing fixes to issues on our GitHub repositories. We have a lot of issues that need attention, and we appreciate any help you can provide. You can also help by reviewing pull requests and providing feedback to other contributors. To get started, check out our [contribution guide](/community/guide).

## Creating modules

If you have an idea for a new module that you think would be useful to the Leaf community, you can create it and submit it to get featured on our documentation. People have vastly different needs, and your module could be the missing piece for someone's project. Reach out to us on Discord if you need help with your module. To get started, check out our [contribution guide](/community/guide).

## Improving the documentation

The documentation is an essential part of any project, and we're always looking for ways to improve it. If you find any errors or have suggestions for how we can make the documentation better, please let us know. You can also contribute to the documentation by submitting pull requests to the [Leaf documentation repository](https://github.com/leafsphp/docs). To get started, check out the [documentation guide](/community/docs-writing-guide).

## Let us know how you're using Leaf

We love hearing about how people are using Leaf in their projects. If you're using Leaf, we'd love to hear about it. You can share your projects on our Discord server or reach out to us on Twitter. We're always happy to see what people are building with Leaf.
