# Support Leaf's Development

Leaf was created as a little project to make writing APIs super easy, but it’s grown since 2019 and today, Leaf is housing a couple of open-source tools covering different software engineering regimes. The tools we maintain here are:

- Leaf PHP framework and modules
- Hanabira & libs
- Naytive & libs

Of course, we are committed to keeping all this open-source and free for everyone to use. However, maintaining and developing new features for Leaf takes up a lot of time and resources. Most of Leaf's costs have been covered by the team members, but the project has grown and so have the expenses. We've reached a point where sustaining and growing Leaf requires more than just part-time efforts from our team. To truly take Leaf to the next level, we need to support maintainers who can dedicate themselves to working on Leaf full-time, and we need your help to make this happen.

By becoming a sponsor, you directly contribute to the growth of the Leaf ecosystem, enabling us to deliver more features, better support, and ongoing updates. Your sponsorship makes a real difference, helping us keep Leaf accessible and free for everyone. Join us in shaping the future of Leaf — every contribution counts!

## How to Sponsor

You can support Leaf through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/leafsphp) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/leaf), where your contributions go into a transparent fund supporting community initiatives, events, and core Leaf activities. Both recurring monthly sponsorships and one-time donations are welcome. Recurring sponsors also enjoy benefits like logo placements, as outlined in our Sponsorship Tiers. Your support directly fuels the growth and sustainability of Leaf and its community.

## Sponsoring Leaf as a Business

Sponsoring Leaf gives you great exposure to all Leaf developers around the world through our website and GitHub project READMEs. In addition, supporting OSS improves the reputation of your brand, which is an important asset for any company that interacts with developers.

If you are using Leaf to build a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Leaf's development: **it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.** The exposure and positive brand image in the Leaf community also makes it easier to attract and recruit developers.

If you are building a product where your target customers are developers, you will gain high quality traffic through the sponsorship exposure, since all our visitors are developers. The sponsorship also builds brand recognition and improves conversion.

## Current Sponsors

We are grateful to all our sponsors for their generous support. Check out our current sponsors below:

## Financial Reports

We are committed to transparency and accountability in our financial management. We publish yearly financial reports to keep our sponsors informed about how their contributions are being used. The reports are always available and contain information up to the current month. They include a breakdown of expenses, revenue, and other financial details. You can find the latest financial reports on [finance.leafphp.dev](https://finance.leafphp.dev).
