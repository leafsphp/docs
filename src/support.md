# We need your help

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e08dd91-db25-407a-9c17-aec25a01e241)

Leaf began in 2019 as a simple boilerplate to simplify API development but has since expanded to include a suite of open-source tools like the Leaf PHP framework and [Hanabira](https://hanajs.dev).

We're committed to keeping Leaf open-source and free, but as the project grows, so do the costs. Maintaining and building new features now takes significant time and resources, mostly covered by our team. To keep Leaf thriving, we need your support for our maintainers üíö

Become a sponsor and help us grow the Leaf ecosystem with more features, better support, and ongoing updates while keeping it free and accessible for everyone.

## How to Sponsor

You can support Leaf through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/leafsphp) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/leaf), where your contributions go into a transparent fund supporting community initiatives, events, and core Leaf activities. Both recurring monthly sponsorships and one-time donations are welcome. Recurring sponsors also enjoy benefits like logo placements, as outlined in our Sponsorship Tiers. Your support directly fuels the growth and sustainability of Leaf and its community.

## Sponsoring Leaf as a Business

Sponsoring Leaf gives you great exposure to all Leaf developers around the world through our website and GitHub project READMEs. In addition, supporting OSS improves the reputation of your brand, which is an important asset for any company that interacts with developers.

If you are using Leaf to build a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Leaf's development: **it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.** The exposure and positive brand image in the Leaf community also makes it easier to attract and recruit developers.

You can join our [Premium Sponsorship üçÅ](https://opencollective.com/leaf/contribute/premium-sponsor-79271) tier which gives you the following perks:

- Your logo on our README on GitHub and our website
- A personalized shoutout on our social media channels & newsletters
- Mention in our monthly progress reports
- Mention in every release annoucement
- Dedicated first priority support from the Leaf team.

## Past/Present Sponsors

## Financial Reports

We are committed to transparency and accountability in our financial management. We publish yearly financial reports to keep our sponsors informed about how their contributions are being used. The reports are always available and contain information up to the current month. They include a breakdown of expenses, revenue, and other financial details. You can find the latest financial reports on [finance.leafphp.dev](https://finance.leafphp.dev).
