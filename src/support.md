# Let’s Shape the Future of PHP 💚

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e08dd91-db25-407a-9c17-aec25a01e241) -->

Dear #leafers!

For years, Leaf has been quietly pushing PHP forward.
We’ve helped developers:

- Ship apps faster with cleaner, simpler code.

- Skip the heavy abstraction and focus on building.

- Join a community that believes in making PHP fun again.

Leaf has grown from a small idea into a framework powering apps, businesses, and side projects around the world. And this is just the beginning.

![leaf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1c739f-7850-4567-88af-215eee8611fb)

Now, we’re preparing to take Leaf to the next level. In the coming year, we will:

- Deliver long-awaited features like real-time APIs, better deployments, more 3rd party integrations, and auto API docs.

- Build a sustainable ecosystem around Leaf — with docs, tutorials, and community tools.

- Keep everything Leaf free and independent, so anyone can build with it.

But to make this possible, we need you.

Your support means Leaf’s maintainers can dedicate focused time to building, fixing, and improving. It means we don’t burn out. And it means Leaf stays healthy for the long run.

— With love and gratitude,

Michael from Leaf
