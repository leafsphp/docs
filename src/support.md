# We need your help

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e08dd91-db25-407a-9c17-aec25a01e241) -->

Leaf began in 2019 as a boilerplate to supercharge API development but has since expanded into a full framework with libraries like [Hanabira](https://hana.leafphp.dev).

We're committed to keeping Leaf free, but as the project grows, so do the costs. Maintaining and building new features now takes significant time and resources, mostly covered by our team. To keep Leaf thriving, we need your support for our maintainers üíö

## How to Sponsor

You can support Leaf through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/leafsphp) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/leaf), where your contributions go into a transparent fund supporting community initiatives, events, and core Leaf activities. Both recurring monthly sponsorships and one-time donations are welcome. Recurring sponsors also enjoy benefits like logo placements, as outlined in our Sponsorship Tiers. Your support directly fuels the growth and sustainability of Leaf and its community.

You can also send in USDT through `TK6d2w4EqSDsf2xB2SLcEkfUt3vxADtFmp` using TRC20.

## Sponsoring Leaf as a Business

Sponsoring Leaf gives you great exposure to all PHP developers around the world through our website and GitHub project READMEs. In addition, supporting OSS improves the reputation of your brand, and also ensures that Leaf stays healthy and actively maintained.

You can join our [Premium Sponsorship üçÅ](https://opencollective.com/leaf/contribute/premium-sponsor-79271) tier which gives you the following perks:

- Your logo on our README on GitHub and our website
- A personalized shoutout on our social media channels & newsletters
- Mention in our monthly progress reports
- Mention in every release annoucement
- Dedicated first priority support from the Leaf team.

## Past/Present Sponsors

We are grateful to all our sponsors, both past and present for their generous support üíö

## Financial Reports

We are committed to transparency and accountability in our financial management. We publish yearly financial reports to keep our sponsors informed about how their contributions are being used. The reports are always available and contain information up to the current month. They include a breakdown of expenses, revenue, and other financial details. You can find the latest financial reports on [finance.leafphp.dev](https://finance.leafphp.dev).
