# Leaf Codelabs

We created Codelabs to give you interactive step-by-step real-world tutorials on Leaf, PHP and JS concepts that help you achieve specific results in your apps. Codelabs takes one topic or "how-to" and dives deep into it, giving you all the information you need to successfully complete the tutorial yourself while also explaining useful concepts along the way.

## Codelabs vs the Docs

Codelabs are hands-on, standalone tutorials focused on specific Leaf features, unlike our docs, which follow a story-like flow. They dive deeper with complex examples that combine features in interesting ways that may not be fully covered in the docs.

While our documentation is beginner-friendly, we only have the space to cover PHP and general web concepts. Codelabs on the other hand will explain any concepts that are essential to that specific tutorial, eg: "how to update your Leaf app on DigitalOcean" will explain DigitalOcean, SSH, and Linux concepts necessary to complete the tutorial.

## Experiments

We call a tutorial in Codelabs an "experiment". Each experiment is a standalone tutorial that focuses on a particular topic. It is interactive and in-depth, covering what is needed in full.

Below is a list of all experiments:

| Topic                                                   | Description                                                    | Author |
